# Advent of Code 2023 with Python

I'm new to Python and practising using Advent of Code. I'll put my solution scripts here.

The test input files won't be included here since afaik they aren't FOSS. I'll instead link to them in each solution script, and you can download the test data and feed it as input through stdin

Happy holidays!
