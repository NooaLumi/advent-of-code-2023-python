# Advent of Code 2023 with Python

I'm new to python, so reference these with caution. I'll only push once I have the correct solution, so at least they're guaranteed to work

The test input files won't be included here since afaik they aren't FOSS. I'll instead link to them in each solution script, and you can download the test data and feed it as input through stdin

Happy holidays!
